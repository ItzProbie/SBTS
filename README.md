# SBTS - Satellite Based Tolling System - A Project 
Developed a multi-user GPS-based tolling system.

Engineered a comprehensive solution utilizing ESP32 microcontrollers and GPS modules to capture real-time latitude and longitude data, seamlessly transmitting it to AWS IoT for processing.

Developed a Node.js server, hosted on an Azure virtual machine to ensure uninterrupted operation. This server efficiently retrieved data from AWS IoT, processed it, and interfaced with RESTful APIs deployed on Vercel. Leveraged RESTful APIs to dynamically calculate toll charges based on route data and seamlessly interfaced with Atlas MongoDB to store comprehensive trip details, ensuring robust data management and analysis.

Designed and implemented an intuitive front-end interface to display trip details, providing users with seamless access to critical information.
